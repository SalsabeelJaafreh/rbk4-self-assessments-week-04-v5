in relational database :the data store in tables so we have a relation between tables we connect between them by key
 , we can normalize the data,and we can identify keys like(primary key),we use relational dbms to manage huge data because we can handle it by multple way not just(copy and paste)
for example,mysql,sqlite

in non relatioanl db:the data store (save) in file so we dont have relation between data,we cant use key , no normalization for data,with this type of db we can deal(handle) just small data;
